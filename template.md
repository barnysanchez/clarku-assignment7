# Instructions for Assignment 7 submission 

***THIS IS PART 1 OF YOUR CAPSTONE PROJECT***

(The purpose of this assignment is for you to deliver a dataset that you will use for your proposed project. Ensure that this has the needed features and structure to support your project.)

You are not to use already made data sets, unless only to compliment or enrich your data, not as the main source of your data set. If you fail to this, it will constitute an inmediate fail of the assignment. 

- Please copy the contents of this markdown as the starting template of your assingment. 
- The resulting file from this programming assingment must be submitted to the private repo you submitted for my review during assignment one. 
- The name of the file has to follow  naming convention:  *lastname*_week10.ipynb
- There are four sections of this assignments required to receive full credit. 
- Please see that the expected file is a Jupyter notebook which contains Python code and markdown, just like shown in class and in my recap video from week 2. 


# Section 1) Data set name submission (10%)

In your private repo, ensure that you save your data set with the name *lastname*_week10_data.(extension)

Your data set file format should be reflected in the name extension. Understanding that your data set can be a csv file (*.csv), an excel file (*.xlsx), sql datase (*.sql), pickle file (*.pkl), etc. 

For example, my dataset would be named:   _sanchez_week10_data.pkl_

# Section 2) Explain your data set, how it is composed, and how you collected it (30%)

For example, if your data set is a csv file, I expect an explanation of every column. Explain what every feature is and the label(s) in place. If your dataset is a collection of images, explain how each is composed, and the classes. 

Bottom line is, do not assume that the consumer of your data set understands your data and your perspective. Explain it. All of it. Every feature or label not explained will deduce points. 

Explain also in this section how you harvested your data. Be very specific, if you must expand the explanation to include actual code that you used, please do. 

Points will be deducted for every aspect of your data not explained.

# Section 3) Load of the data set (10%)

Show how to load your data set. I will load your data set too. It must load properly for full credit or zero credit if it loads with errors. 

(Just to be very clear, I expect your data sets to be single files. The data set should have the structure in place to hold the data samples, the features and labels.) 

# Section 4) Show me your data!!!!!!! (50%)

Show off your data. Here are some of the things that I expect that you show, according to your data:
- How big your data set is 
- Graph, plotting of some of your data samples for different classes
- Histograms
- Distributions
- Data shape 
- Format
- Randomization of your data 

Provide a recommendation of train versus test data. 

Don't limit youself. It's your data. Do your best to truly show me your data. Think about everything you want me to see and highlight.
